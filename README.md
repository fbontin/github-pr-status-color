# Github Pull Request Status Color

This browser add-on will, when a list of PRs are shown in Github, color the words declaring the status of each pull request.

 - Approved: Green
 - Changes Requested: Blue
 - Review Required: Orange

Code is initially forked from [Mozillas WebExtension examples](https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples).

### Add to Firefox
1. Go to releases and download `github_pr_status_color-1.0-an+fx.xpi`
2. Drag and drop it on Firefox
3. Accept and install

### Add to Chrome
Since I don't want to release this to the Chrome Web Store, these instructions are a bit tricky:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:fbontin/github-pr-status-color.git`
2. Open Chrome and go to extensions
3. Enable developer mode (in the upper right corner)
4. Click `Load unpacked` in the upper left corner
5. Select the folder you just cloned
6. It should be installed!
